</div>

<div  class="container">
    <h4 class="header">User One</h4>
    <p> The first user of the interface clicked around each of the tip options a few times. They paused, 
        looked back at the screen, then finally clicked the “no tip” button. Their signature was very short, 
        only a small squiggly line, before they pressed continue and quickly walked away. There is a second 
        screen after “continue,” which asks for the user’s signature. User 1 walked away before they saw 
        that this screen even appeared.  </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Is there anything that confuses you when using the toast payment? </li>
        <li>What would you like to change about the toast payment? </li>
        <li>Is this your first time using the toast payment?</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Not until after I informed them, User 1 did not know that there was a second screen 
            which appeared after they clicked “continue.” </li>
        <li>User 1 thought that the “no tip” button was not made clear enough - on first looking 
            at the screen, User 1 thought that they were being required to give a tip. </li>
        <li>User 1 would prefer to not use a screen and would rather just interact with the cash register worker.</li>
        <li>This was User 1’s first time using the toast payment system at Ceremony tea.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div  class="container">
    <h4 class="header">User Two</h4>
    <p> The second user pressed a custom tip immediately after looking at the screen. They clicked a 
        custom tip, quickly typed in $1.00. After clicking the “continue” button, the second screen, 
        rather than asking for the user’s email address, already had that section populated (i.e. User 
        2’s email was already automatically entered). User 2 pressed “next” and the screen showed that 
        they earned 6 stars! User 2 smiled, said “thank you” to the cash register worker and walked away.   
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Is there anything difficult about using the toast payment?</li>
        <li>How would you describe your experience using the toast payment?  </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Not until after I informed them, User 1 did not know that there was a second screen 
            which appeared after they clicked “continue.” </li>
        <li>The first few times they came to Ceremony, User 2 recalled having a more difficult time using the toast payment system.  </li>
        <li>User 2 is a regular Ceremony customer. </li>
        <li>Because User 2 visits Ceremony often, the system stores their information, so when they pay with their credit card, their email is automatically entered. </li>
        <li>User 2 enjoys the toast payment system because they can customize a tip, and they earn stars which translate to discounts on drinks!</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div  class="container">
    <h4 class="header">User Three</h4>
    <p> The third user clicked the 20% tip button, pressed “continue” then asked the cash register worker 
        if they should enter their email or not. The cash register worker explained the purpose of entering 
        an email (ability to make a membership with Ceremony, then earn stars, which will culminate to 
        discounts on drinks). User 3 smiled, said “thanks, cool, I will sign up.” After attempting to type 
        in their email with one hand, User 3 set down the phone and wallet they were holding, typed out 
        their email, and pressed “next.”    
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Did you make any mistakes when using the toast payment? </li>
        <li>Did you have any problems with using toast payment?  </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>User 3 said that the experience was easy to understand, when adding a tip onto their order.  </li>
        <li>User 3 noted that the screen could provide more information on what the email entering purpose is, so that they did not have to ask a worker. </li>
        <li>User 3 struggled slightly with entering their email address into the system, making some mistakes when trying to type with one hand.  </li>
        <li>User 3’s experience could have been better if there was an easier way to enter their email - they also felt uncomfortable that other 
            customers were waiting and watching behind them as they typed.  </li>
    </ul>

<div class="container">
    <h4 id="specialHeader" class="header" >Takeaways</h4>
    <body>
        Overall, users described the toast payment system as straight-forward and easy to use. One 
        complaint was that finding where to select no tip was confusing. Additionally, the greater 
        number times that the user had previously used toast appeared to increase their overall experience 
        with it. Making an account through toast is beneficial because in future purchases, users do not 
        need to re-enter their email, which can be time-confusing and stressful. Users did appreciate the 
        ability to customize tips or calculate tip percentages on their own.
